TypeScript has become the go-to language for building robust and scalable web applications. By adding static typing to JavaScript, it helps developers catch errors early and improve code maintainability.

## Why TypeScript?
- **Type Safety** → Prevents common runtime errors.
- **Better Code Readability** → Self-documenting types improve maintainability.
- **Enhanced Tooling** → IDEs provide autocompletion, refactoring, and type checking.

## Best Practices for Writing Better TypeScript Code

### 1. Use Strict Mode
Enable strict mode in your `tsconfig.json` to enforce better type checking:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true
  }
}
```

Strict mode enables `strictNullChecks`, `noImplicitAny`, and other rules that make TypeScript more reliable.

### 2. Prefer Interfaces Over Types for Objects
When defining object shapes, prefer **interfaces** over **type aliases** for better performance and extendability.

```ts
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}
```

Interfaces can be extended, making them more flexible for complex structures.

### 3. Use Union and Intersection Types Wisely
TypeScript's powerful **union (`|`)** and **intersection (`&`)** types enable flexible type definitions.

```ts
type SuccessResponse = { success: true; data: string };
type ErrorResponse = { success: false; error: string };
type ApiResponse = SuccessResponse | ErrorResponse;
```

### 4. Avoid `any`, Use `unknown` or Generics Instead
The `any` type disables type checking, which defeats the purpose of TypeScript. Use `unknown` if you must accept arbitrary values.

```ts
function processValue(value: unknown) {
  if (typeof value === "string") {
    console.log(value.toUpperCase());
  }
}
```

### 5. Use Utility Types
TypeScript provides built-in utility types like `Partial`, `Readonly`, `Pick`, and `Omit` to manipulate types efficiently.

```ts
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

type ReadOnlyUser = Readonly<User>;
type UserPreview = Pick<User, "id" | "name">;
```

### 6. Write Type-Safe Functions
Always define function return types explicitly to prevent unintended behavior.

```ts
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```

### 7. Leverage `as const` for Immutable Data
Use `as const` to make objects fully immutable and infer literal types.

```ts
const STATUS = {
  SUCCESS: "success",
  ERROR: "error",
} as const;

type StatusType = keyof typeof STATUS;
```

## Conclusion
By following these TypeScript best practices, you can write more reliable, scalable, and maintainable code. TypeScript's static typing and powerful features provide a better development experience while reducing bugs in production.
