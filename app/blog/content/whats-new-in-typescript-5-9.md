With the release of TypeScript 5.9, the language has slimmed down and gotten smarter. This update introduces several improvements that make everyday development smoother and builds faster.

## 1. A Cleaner ```tsc --init```

Running ```tsc --init``` no longer produces a massive 200-line tsconfig.json full of commented-out options.
The new default is much leaner and ships with only the most useful settings, like:

```json
{
  "moduleDetection": "force",
  "target": "esnext"
}
```

## 2. Deferred Imports with import defer

The new import defer syntax lets you declare a module upfront but only execute it when one of its exports is actually used.
This is especially handy for:

Large modules with heavy initialization costs

Conditional, platform-specific code

Dependencies that aren’t always required

## 3. Friendlier Editor Tooltips

In VS Code, hover tooltips can now be expanded and collapsed inline with +/- buttons, giving you a quick way to peek deeper into complex types.

Many DOM APIs now include short, MDN-sourced descriptions right in the tooltip—no more context switching to the browser for a quick reminder.

## 4. Under-the-Hood Performance Gains

TypeScript now caches more intermediate type computations, a big performance win for codebases that rely heavily on libraries like Zod or tRPC.

File existence checks have been reduced, shaving off additional compilation time.

## Bottom Line

TypeScript 5.9 is leaner, faster, and more developer-friendly.
Cleaner configs, deferred imports, smarter tooltips, and performance boosts make this a solid update for any project.
