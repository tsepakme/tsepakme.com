Something feels off in frontend right now.

Jobs seem fewer, requirements higher, and roles blur into everything at once.  
Senior no longer means *just* years of experience.

If that matches your gut feeling, you are not imagining it.


## Something Feels Off

The market mood is real:
- Fewer postings
- Wider expectations
- Titles that do not map to real responsibilities

It is easy to read this as “frontend is dying.”  
But what is actually happening is more subtle.


## What Actually Changed

A few shifts quietly changed the shape of frontend work:

- **Frameworks stabilized** → less routine implementation
- **AI absorbed boilerplate** → less CRUD and setup work
- **Companies expect impact** → not just output

Teams want developers who can own outcomes, not just ship tickets.
In many teams, a feature that once needed three people now ships with one strong owner and better tooling.


## Frontend Roles Are Splitting

Frontend is no longer a single role. It is splitting into tracks:

- **UI-heavy frontend** → design systems, motion, accessibility
- **Performance / platform frontend** → rendering, hydration, tooling
- **Product-oriented frontend** → conversion, experiments, UX
- **DX / infra frontend** → build systems, developer experience, CI

One role cannot cover all of this well.  
Specialization is a feature, not a failure.
Most teams blend two tracks, but rarely all four.


## What Skills Actually Matter Now

Framework knowledge is table stakes. Judgment is the differentiator.

The skills that matter most are not about syntax:

- Performance and perceived performance
- UX literacy
- Architecture and tradeoffs
- Reading product metrics
- Communicating decisions and constraints

This is the difference between writing code and building product.


## Where AI Fits (Without Hype)

AI does accelerate the work:
- Faster scaffolding and fewer repetitive tasks
- More throughput

But it does not solve:
- UX
- architecture
- responsibility

AI reduces effort. It does not replace ownership.


## Conclusion

Frontend is becoming harder — and more valuable.

What used to be “HTML + a framework” is now a product craft.  
That is why performance, UX, and DX matter more than ever.
The best move now is to pick a lane and build deep judgment in it.
